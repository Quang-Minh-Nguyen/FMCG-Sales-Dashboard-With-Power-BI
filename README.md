In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis and visualized the sales data from a FMCG brand. To be more specific, while the reporting involves capturing of general sales figures and detailed information based on Month/Year, Products, Channels and Geography, the analysis will focus on providing information about Sales value and Growth rate as the requirements stated. 

## Step 1: Data Importing & Transforming 

From my experience, I always want to look into the files before importing them. In this case, the data was stored in folers and the files are divided into quarters and year halfs:

This means I will use folder import to combine the files.
